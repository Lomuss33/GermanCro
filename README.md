## How it works

Type the German translation of each English word. Croatian is shown as a hint below.  
Every word is broken into a character grid — first letters revealed, punctuation auto-filled, the rest is up to you.

## Features

- **230 vocabulary cards** across 5 categories: Ingenieurwesen, Methodik, Argumentation, Beschreibung, Soft Skills
- **Category selector** — drill a specific topic or go fully mixed
- **Live character grid** — see exactly which letters you got right as you type
- **Streak tracker**, accuracy %, WPM counter
- **Hint button** reveals 3 more characters at a time
- Zero dependencies. One file. No build step.

## Usage

```bash
open main.html
```

That's it.
